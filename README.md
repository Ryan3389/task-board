# task-board

## Description
This is a project designed for employers, employees, students, or anyone who needs help staying organized when finishing several projects. This application sorts projects by due date, changing the background color based on due date. Each task is draggable, allowing you to drop each task into its appropriate container.


## Note
The code written in this project was written by myself. I used Xpert Learning Assistant throughout this project to help with bugs, questions, and when I needed direction. To clarify, the code was written completely by myself.
